I have provided post.input, in.input, pre.input based on the examples
provided by the proffessor, of course they can be overwritten.  

My code evalaues postfix, infix, and prefix inputs as well as evaluates the
expression.  For infix notation it does not recognize parensises however
does work for any other expression.

The class defintions are: tree.py, stack.py

Also included are the provided file: lexer.py

Problem1.py holds all the methods.

post.py, in.py, pre.py, and eval.py print out the answers in the format requested.

The make file can run it.
